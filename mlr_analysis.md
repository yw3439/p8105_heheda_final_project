Consumption of fast food is a key aspect of eating health nowadays.
Generally, for a long period, fast food has been related with bad eating
habits and bad physical health. Using BMI as the parameter, we are going
to measure the correlation between eating health and the consumption of
fast food. Accompanied with the fast food consumption, the frequency of
exercise also is incorporated in the regression model for exploring its
potential interaction with BMI under the effect of fast food
consumption.
