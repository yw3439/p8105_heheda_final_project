  Consumption of fast food is a key aspect of eating health nowadays. Generally, for a long period, fast food has been related with bad eating habits and bad physical health. Using BMI as the parameter, we are going to measure the correlation between eating health and the consumption of fast food. Accompanied with the fast food consumption, the frequency of exercise also is incorporated in the regression model for exploring its potential interaction with BMI under the effect of fast food consumption.
